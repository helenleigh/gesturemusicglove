Gesture controlled music glove with two microbits

This is a fun way of uaing gesture to trigger samples I record when I hear interesting sounds. The project is a mish mash of various people's work so I don't take credit for it - I am just documenting it in case other people want to have fun with gesture controlled noises using Â£20 worth of hardware and some free software! 

CREDITS

The hex files for the Pure Data received and Pure Data transmitter come from written by the delightful sound artists and UK based teacher Tom Fox. Find his work at @vulpstrements. He wrote up his version on his blog https://vulpestruments.com/2018/11/21/how-to-connect-your-mini-mu-to-puredata/ 

For triggering the synth, I actually used Purr Data not Pure Data as I find it more reliable. The patch I've uploaded here is based on one written by Andrew Hockey, a composer and excellent sound wierdo you can find on twitter or insta @andrewrhockey. 

The sounds in the example file are recorded by me at the makerspace in Chicago Pumping Station One, except for the two cello sounds which are part of Sister Moon's awesome sound art project where she bounces samples of various instruments off the moon. Sister Moon is led by Martine-Nicole Rojina and the cello was played by Federico Bragetti.
